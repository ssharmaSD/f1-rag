# Formula 1 Engineering and Technology

## Aerodynamics

### Downforce
- **Purpose**: Increases tire grip by pushing car down onto track
- **Generation**: Through wings, diffusers, and ground effect
- **Trade-off**: More downforce = more drag = slower top speed
- **Balance**: Teams optimize for each circuit's characteristics

### Key Aerodynamic Components

#### Front Wing
- **Function**: Directs airflow around car and generates front downforce
- **Adjustability**: Limited adjustments allowed during race weekend
- **Complexity**: Multiple elements with intricate shapes
- **Ground clearance**: Must be at least 25mm above track

#### Rear Wing
- **Function**: Generates rear downforce and balances car
- **DRS**: Drag Reduction System for overtaking zones
- **Activation**: Driver-controlled when within 1 second of car ahead
- **Effect**: Reduces drag by up to 15%

#### Diffuser
- **Function**: Accelerates air under car, creating suction effect
- **Ground effect**: Works with floor to generate significant downforce
- **Design**: Complex curved surfaces to maximize airflow acceleration
