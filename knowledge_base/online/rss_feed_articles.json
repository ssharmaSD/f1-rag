    "summary": "Sport news<p>Red Bull Racing’s Max Verstappen took a dominant Azerbaijan Grand Prix victory almost 15 seconds ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell as Carlos Sainz gave Williams its first podium finish in four years with third place. It was a disappointing weekend for McLaren, however, with championship leader Oscar Piastri crashed out on lap one and title contender Lando Norris finished seventh. </p><p>When the lights went out at the start Verstappen got away well from pole to take the lead ahead of Sainz, with Racing Bulls driver Liam Lawson holding his starting position of third. </p><p>However, further back in the top 10 drama was unfolding. Piastri, starting from ninth, moved in his grid slot ahead of the start. His anti-stall engaged and as he tried to get going, the full field swept past, dropping the championship leader driver to last. The Australian set about trying to recover but going into Turn 5 he locked up, hit the wall and exited the race. </p><p>The Safety Car was deployed and after a three-lap neutralisation the action got underway again. Verstappen controlled the restart well and within a handful of corners he had built a 1.4s gap to Sainz. Behind them fourth-placed Kimi Antonelli squeezed team-mate Russell towards the barriers and Red Bull’s Yuki pounced, worming his way past the Briton to steal P5. Russell soon began to fight back and on lap nine he closed right up to the Japanese driver and powered past on the run to Turn 3. </p><p>At the front, Verstappen was in full control and by lap 16 the Dutchman had a solid five-second lead over Sainz who was in turn more than three tenths clear of Lawson who was being pressured by both Mercedes drivers. </p><p>Antonelli, bottled up behind Lawson, was the first of the front runners to make a pit stop, diving in at the end of lap 18 to swap his starting Mediums for Hard tyres. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc was next in and he too made the same switch on the following lap, with Lawson pitting on the next lap. </p><p>At half distance, Max was 7.5s clear of Sainz whose four-second advantage over Russell was slowly being eroded. Yuki was four seconds behind the lead Mercedes and two seconds clear of Norris who was going long on his starting Medium tyres. </p><p>Sainz made his switch from Mediums to Hard tyres on lap 28 and he rejoined in sixth place, behind Hard tyre starter Hamilton. That promoted Yuki to a podium position, but our Japanese driver had Norris two seconds behind.</p><p>Norris made his stop at the end of lap 38, attempting to undercut Tsunoda, but the McLaren driver had a slow stop and the four-second delay put him behind both Lawson and Leclerc.</p><p>Tsunoda made his stop on the next lap and he eventually slotted into P6, behind Lawson and ahead of Leclerc and Norris. </p><p>Verstappen finally made his stop for Mediums on lap 41 and he returned to the lead ahead of Russell who had emerged from his stop ahead of Sainz and Antonelli. The major battle became the one for fifth. </p><p>Lawson rose to the challenge, however, and despite come under heavy pressure from Tsunoda over the final quarter of the race, the New Zealander drove superbly to score his best ever result in F1 with fifth. </p><p>Despite not being able to get past the Racing Bulls car, Tsunoda also held his nerve ahead of the hard-charging Norris and he scored his best result as a Red Bull driver with P6. Behind Norris, Hamilton snuck past Leclerc to take P8 at the flag. The final point went to Racing Bulls’ Isack Hadjar. </p><p>At the front, Verstappen punched in the fastest lap on the penultimate tour to seal his sixth grand chelem. The result in Baku put him level with Lewis Hamilton and just two behind all-time record holder Jim Clark. </p><p><br /><strong>2025 FIA Formula 1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix – Race </strong><br />1 Max Verstappen Red Bull/Honda RBPT 51 1:33'26.408 <br />2 George Russell Mercedes 51 1:33'41.017 14.609<br />3 Carlos Sainz Williams/Mercedes 51 1:33'45.607 19.199<br />4 Kimi Antonelli Mercedes 51 1:33'48.168 21.760<br />5 Liam Lawson Racing Bulls/Honda RBPT 51 1:33'59.698 33.290<br />6 Yuki Tsunoda Red Bull/Honda RBPT 51 1:34'00.216 33.808<br />7 Lando Norris McLaren/Mercedes 51 1:34'00.635 34.227<br />8 Lewis Hamilton Ferrari 51 1:34'02.718 36.310<br />9 Charles Leclerc Ferrari 51 1:34'03.182 36.774<br />10 Isack Hadjar Racing Bulls/Honda RBPT 51 1:34'05.390 38.982<br />11 Gabriel Bortoleto Sauber/Ferrari 51 1:34'34.014 1'07.606<br />12 Oliver Bearman Haas/Ferrari 51 1:34'34.670 1'08.262<br />13 Alexander Albon Williams/Mercedes 51 1:34'39.278 1'12.870<br />14 Esteban Ocon Haas/Ferrari 51 1:34'43.988 1'17.580<br />15 Fernando Alonso Aston Martin/Mercedes 51 1:34'45.115 1'18.707<br />16 Nico Hülkenberg Sauber/Ferrari 51 1:34'46.645 1'20.237<br />17 Lance Stroll Aston Martin/Mercedes 51 1:35'02.800 1'36.392<br />18 Pierre Gasly Alpine/Renault 50 1:33'30.273 1 lap /3.865<br />19 Franco Colapinto Alpine/Renault 50 1:33'32.733 1 lap /6.325<br />     Oscar Piastri McLaren/Mercedes 0 - Accident</p><p> </p>  <a href=\"https://www.fia.com/championship/fia-formula-one-world-championship\">FIA Formula One World Championship</a><div class=\"category-icon news\"></div><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/tags/f1\">F1</a><img alt=\"\" height=\"3431\" src=\"https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/news/main_image/dppi_00125020_1662.jpg\" width=\"5146\" /><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/2071\">SEASON 2025</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/12\">Sport</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/family/circuit\">Circuit</a>1SportFIA Formula One World ChampionshipCircuitSEASON 2025F101<span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, September 21, 2025 - 4:41pm</span><span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, September 21, 2025 - 4:41pm</span>",

    "summary": "Sport news<p>Max Verstappen took a dramatic sixth pole of the season in Baku beating surprise front-row qualifier Carlos Sainz and third-placed Liam Lawson at the end of a marathon session that saw championship leader Oscar Piastri and Charles Leclerc crash out as red flags were flown six times. </p><p>At the start of Q1, Ferrari’s Leclerc, on Soft tyres, took top spot thanks to a lap of 1:41.982 with Verstappen slotting into P2, two tenths off the Ferrari driver and two ahead of Norris. However, as the opening runs came to an end, the red flags were displayed for the first time. </p><p>Williams’ Alex Albon clipped the wall on the inside of Turn 1 and with his front-left suspension broken the Williams driver stopped on track. The incident left Piastri and Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli without a time on the board. </p><p>When the session resumed, Lewis Hamilton put the other Ferrari top with a lap of 1:41.821. Piastri then jumped from P20 to P2, a little over a tenth ahead of Leclerc and Verstappen. </p><p>However, as those runs came to an end the red flags came out again. Kick Sauber’s Nico Hülkenberg hit the wall in Turn 4 and though he was able to limp back to the pits minus a front wing, the session was halted. </p><p>When the action got going again Norris, on Softs, took top spot with a time of 1:41.322. Verstappen also found more time, climbing to P2, just 0.009s off the McLaren driver. </p><p>With only seconds remaining the red flags appeared for a third time. Alpine’s Pierre Gasly brought out the red flags when he went deep into the escape road at Turn 4 and then team-mate Franco Colapinto clouted the wall on the exit of the same corner. Colapinto dropped out in P16, and he was followed to the exit by Hülkenberg, Haas’ Esteban Ocon, Gasly and Albon. </p><p> Almost as soon as Q2 got underway, the red flags were waved again. Haas’ Oliver Bearman hit the concrete wall on the exit of Turn 2 and he ground to a halt on the run to the following corner.</p><p>With Bearman’s Haas removed from the track and the session underway once more Norris and Verstappen continued to battle for top spot, with the McLaren driver taking P1 with a lap of 1:41.39 while the Red Bull driver claimed P2, five hundredths of a second off the pace. </p><p>Behind them Leclerc, who had made mistakes earlier in the session and had not posted a time, needed a clean lap and his final flyer jumped him into the top. That pushed Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda into the drop zone but the Japanese driver dug deep and scraped into the top 10 shootout at the expense of Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso who dropped out ahead of Hamilton, Sauber’s Gabriel Bortoleto, the second Aston of Lance Stroll and the unfortunate Bearman. </p><p>As the final session got underway small droplets of rain began to and with moments Mercedes’ George Russell was sliding up the escape road at Turn 4. Verstappen was swiftly on the radio saying, “it's too slippery. Now Russell goes straight - it's raining.” </p><p>It appeared, however, that Leclerc didn’t read the conditions quite as well. The Monegasque driver locked up into Turn 15 and after he hit the barriers, the red flags were flown yet again. </p><p>Under the red flags just three drivers – provisional pole sitter Carlos Sainz and the twin Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar – had times on the board and the final runs would all be about who could hold their nerve best. </p><p>And Piastri was the first to falter. The championship leader went too hot into Turn 3 and in similar style to Leclerc he arrowed straight into the barriers to halt the session for a sixth time. </p><p>When the session resumed for the last time, with enough on the clock for a single run, it was Verstappen who kept his cool best. </p><p>Norris, first out on track, was too ragged and when he scraped the wall on the outside of Turn 15 his lap was gone and he slid down the order. </p><p>Verstappen, though, was flawless and when the four-time champion crossed the line it was in 1:41.117 enough to deliver a first Baku pole ahead of Sainz and Lawson.</p><p>Russell and Kimi Antonelli took P5 and P6 respectively for Mercedes, while Tsunoda took his best ever qualifying spot with Red Bull in P6, ahead of Norris, Hadjar, Piastri and Leclerc. </p><p><strong>2025 FIA Formula 1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix – Qualifying</strong><br />1 Max Verstappen Red Bull/Honda RBPT 1:41.117 - -<br />2 Carlos Sainz Williams/Mercedes 1:41.595 0.478 <br />3 Liam Lawson Racing Bulls/Honda RBPT 1:41.707 0.590 <br />4 Kimi Antonelli Mercedes 1:41.717 0.600 <br />5 George Russell Mercedes 1:42.070 0.953 <br />6 Yuki Tsunoda Red Bull/Honda RBPT 1:42.143 1.026 <br />7 Lando Norris McLaren/Mercedes 1:42.239 1.122 <br />8 Isack Hadjar Racing Bulls/Honda RBPT 1:42.372 1.255 <br />9 Oscar Piastri McLaren/Mercedes - - -<br />10 Charles Leclerc Ferrari - - -<br />11 Fernando Alonso Aston Martin/Mercedes 1:41.857 0.740 <br />12 Lewis Hamilton Ferrari 1:42.183 1.066 <br />13 Gabriel Bortoleto Sauber/Ferrari 1:42.277 1.160 <br />14 Lance Stroll Aston Martin/Mercedes 1:43.061 1.944 <br />15 Oliver Bearman Haas/Ferrari - - -<br />16 Franco Colapinto Alpine/Renault 1:42.779 1.662 <br />17 Nico Hülkenberg Sauber/Ferrari 1:42.916 1.799 <br />18 Esteban Ocon Haas/Ferrari 1:43.004 1.887 <br />19 Pierre Gasly Alpine/Renault 1:43.139 2.022 <br />20 Alexander Albon Williams/Mercedes 1:43.778 2.661<br /> </p>  <a href=\"https://www.fia.com/championship/fia-formula-one-world-championship\">FIA Formula One World Championship</a><div class=\"category-icon news\"></div><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/tags/f1\">F1</a><img alt=\"\" height=\"4000\" src=\"https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/news/main_image/dppi_00125020_1177.jpg\" width=\"6000\" /><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/2071\">SEASON 2025</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/12\">Sport</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/family/circuit\">Circuit</a>1SportFIA Formula One World ChampionshipCircuitSEASON 2025F101<span class=\"date-display-single\">Saturday, September 20, 2025 - 5:45pm</span><span class=\"date-display-single\">Saturday, September 20, 2025 - 5:45pm</span>",

You said on the radio on the way in that it is the best moment of your career. Just tell us what this moment means to you.</strong><br /><strong>Carlos SAINZ: </strong>Yeah. Honestly, I cannot describe how happy I am, how good this feels. This is even better than my first ever podium that I did. We've been fighting hard all year and finally today, we just proved that when we have the speed — we've had it all year — and everything comes together, we can do some amazing things together. And yeah, today we nailed the race. Not one mistake, and we managed to beat a lot of cars that yesterday I wasn't expecting to beat.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: We talked a little bit earlier in the week about how you've had pace at a lot of the races in the last few — it's just been a failure to convert for a various amount of reasons. How proud are you of yourself on track, and the team, of course, for their ability to convert from a strategy standpoint today?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> Yeah. I'm extremely proud of everyone at Williams for pushing through our very difficult year. I think we've proven to everyone the massive step that we took compared to last year. We are on the rise; we are in the right direction. Unfortunately, with me, we've had a lot of bad luck, a lot of incidents — very difficult to convert all that pace into results. But now I understand why it all happened, because the first podium needed to come like this. It's just life, you know? Life just sometimes brings you those bad moments to give you a very nice one, and this stays much better than any other thing that I was expecting. So, just a life lesson, to keep believing, keep trusting yourself, your team around you, your procedures, everything that you're doing — because sooner or later, it always pays off.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Cool. We'll go and join with your team. Congratulations.</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> Thank you very much.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: P2 for George Russell today. You said before the race that a podium was a possibility, and you had incredible pace on those Hard tyres. We even heard you pre-empt a message from the pit wall to extend that stint. Was that the key today to get ahead of Carlos?</strong><br /><strong>George RUSSELL:</strong> Yeah. I mean, firstly, congrats to Carlos and Williams. Amazing result for them. I think for us, really happy to be back on the podium. It's been a bit of a rough weekend for me personally, but the car was great. Lewis came in P4 as well, so happy with that.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: You talked about a rough week for you personally — a bit under the weather. So how tough was it to sort of focus, and how are you feeling after 51 laps?</strong><br /><strong>GR:</strong> Yeah, I was pretty glad when I saw the chequered flag, to be honest. I was fortunate — I felt much better today than I felt on Friday and Saturday. So yeah, looking forward to a bit of rest now. But as I said, just happy with the result. And for us as a team, trying to beat Ferrari in the Constructors’ was a good step towards that.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Absolutely. Well, congratulations. Go get some rest. Max, 67th win of your career, second in a row. That looked like Max 2023 — as straightforward as it gets. Did it feel that easy from inside the car?</strong><br /><strong>Max VERSTAPPEN:</strong> They're all a bit different, but I think this weekend has been incredible for us. Of course, last weekend was already great. But yeah, for us to win here again is just fantastic. And I think also in the race, the car was working really well. On both of the compounds, we had clean air all the time, and you could then look after your tyres. And yeah, it was pretty straightforward. Of course, it's not easy around here — very windy today, so the car is always moving around a lot. But yeah, of course, incredibly happy with this performance.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: After the conditions we saw yesterday and all the problems in qualifying — you mentioned the wind, similar conditions today. How surprised were you that there weren’t more incidents, that we didn’t have more Safety Cars or even a red flag? Is that the drivers just learning from yesterday, or was it maybe not as hard today?</strong><br /><strong>MV: </strong>I think in the race, always, you have to be a little bit more careful, right? Also, with tyre management and stuff, you want to make the one-stop work. So I think everyone was a bit more cautious with that anyway. Plus, of course, the compounds that we're running today — Medium and Hard — they weren’t really used that much up until today, and that all helped. And yeah, for sure I was happy that there were not too many Safety Cars.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Max, two wins on the trot. This Red Bull car seems to have really taken a step forward the last few weeks. Are you confident that this sort of pace, this sort of relative competitiveness can continue all the way to the end of the season?</strong><br /><strong>MV: </strong>Difficult to say at the moment, but for sure the last two race weekends have been amazing for us. Singapore — completely different challenge again with the high downforce. So we'll see what we can do there.<br /> <br /> <br /><strong>PRESS CONFERENCE</strong><br /> <br /><strong>Q: Very well done, Max. A very dominant victory for you today. Just how sweet was the performance?</strong><br /><strong>MV:</strong> I think overall, just a great weekend for us. I think for sure, you know, starting up front was key, especially in the beginning, just managing your tyres to go long. But, yeah, overall, very happy with how the race was going. I mean, I could go very long in that first stint. The car was doing pretty much what I wanted it to do. Just how much you commit, right, to push around here, which is not always easy with the layout of the track, the wind as well. It was quite tough today with that. But, yeah, we just stayed out until basically everyone pitted. And then there were only a few laps left on the medium, clearing a few backmarkers, which took a bit of time. But after that, just bringing it home. And for us, that’s another just great result. A bit unusual. This season has been really swinging left and right, but at least now two weekends in a row, it’s been going really well.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: You say it’s been swinging left and right. Was this the best the car has felt all season?</strong><br /><strong>MV:</strong> I guess together with Monza. Yep. Monza has never really been a particularly strong track for us, so to do that, that was already a big plus. And I guess all in all for me here in Baku, it’s been alright, but never amazing — apart from maybe '21, '22, I guess. But the rest has always been a bit difficult. So, yeah, to have a weekend like this, it was very important.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: How much of a risk was it to start the race on the Hard tyre given that you hadn’t run on it up until that point?</strong><br /><strong>MV:</strong> Well, not so much from knowing how good it would be. It’s more like the start or an untimely Safety Car. So as soon as we crossed, like, 20 laps into the race, I was a bit happier, but it was a bit of a risk. I think it’s a bit unusual, of course, when you’re on pole, to start on the hardest compound that is available. But we did it, and I think it was the right call. We said before the race, well, one way or another one strategy will work, and we’ll come out of the race happy with it. Luckily, we chose the right one.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Now, Max, you’re only 69 points behind Oscar Piastri in the Drivers' Championship. Given the recent upswing in competitiveness, does it give you a smidgen of hope that the title is within range again?</strong><br /><strong>MV:</strong> I mean, I don’t rely on hope. But it’s seven rounds left – 69 points is a lot. So I personally don’t think about it. I just go race by race, what I have been doing basically the whole season — just trying to do the best we can, try to score the most points that we can. And then after Abu Dhabi, we’ll know.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: And given where the car is now, do you have a little bit more hope going to Singapore, a race where Red Bull’s never won?</strong><br /><strong>MV:</strong> Well, I have never won. Red Bull has won, right? We’ll see. It’s completely different. High downforce. A lot of deg on the tyres, so we’ll see what happens. I really don’t know at the moment.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Alright. Very well done today. Thank you very much, Max. George, let’s come to you. Great race by you. What was the key to the climb up to P2 today?</strong><br /><strong>GR:</strong> I think it was just staying out of trouble, to be honest. I don’t think we had a spectacular weekend, to be honest. And, obviously, Carlos just did an amazing job, and Liam also did a great job yesterday qualifying ahead of us. But all of the cars who we ordinarily fight sort of made mistakes or underperformed, and we sort of picked up the pieces. So, obviously, really happy to finish P2 all things considered. But also, I think the cool temps helped us a little bit. So just good to capitalise on all of those things.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Do you have a better race car or qualifying car at the moment?</strong><br /><strong>GR:</strong> I think it’s very dependent circuit to circuit. Definitely, this weekend, the conditions and the circuit layout probably suited our car better than we’ll see in Singapore. But right now, the field is so compact and overtaking is pretty difficult. So it seems like anybody can do an amazing lap and get themselves up the order. And, to be honest, it’s pretty incredible seeing the likes of Carlos, Hülkenberg, Hadjar on the podium this season.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: You’ve been under the weather all weekend. Sounding a bit like Barry White. Just how tough was it physically for you?</strong><br /><strong>GR:</strong> Well, fortunately, it was Baku. Even though it’s one of the toughest circuits, mentally and physically it’s maybe one of the easiest. So today I’m much better. Friday and Saturday, I was really rough. And, you know, had it been Singapore, as an example, I think I probably would have called it a day on Friday, to be honest, and probably wouldn’t have done the race. So, yeah, sort of fortunate timing. And I haven’t been ill for a couple of years, actually, so it just all sort of hit me at once these days, but I’m on the up now.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Quick word on the Constructors’ Championship, please. Mercedes in P2, four points now ahead of Ferrari. How do you see this one playing out over the remaining seven races? Do you expect it to go to the wire, or do you think one of you will gain an advantage?</strong><br /><strong>GR:</strong> Well, I think right now with the current form, there’s as much chance of Max finishing ahead of us as there is Ferrari, to be honest.<br /><strong>MV:</strong> Red Bull, no?<br /><strong>GR: </strong>Yeah, team Verstappen! But, yeah — sorry, I lost my train of thought there. It just swings so quickly. Ferrari were looking amazingly strong on Friday here, and they’ve always been great here. You know, Charles has been on pole four times here, and they could have easily been one-two on the grid. And with how difficult overtaking is, they probably would have finished one-two as well. But, obviously, they had a bad qualifying, and they came away with single-figure points, and we were the ones coming away with 30 points, so nobody knows.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Very well done. Thank you for that. Carlos, if we could come to you. First podium for Williams — very well done. What was the key to this result, first of all?</strong><br /><strong>Carlos SAINZ:</strong> The key was probably just nailing a perfect weekend from practice, quali, to race. It’s what I’ve been looking for since the beginning of the season — just to nail a perfect weekend. I think we had almost a perfect one in Jeddah when we scored maximum points, but then the rest of the season has been really up and down with a lot more downs than ups. Very unlucky in some cases. Job not well done in others — by me or by other things that were in our control. But I always said to the team from the beginning that whenever a first big opportunity of fighting for a podium comes, as long as we have everything under control and nothing goes wrong and we prove to everyone what we’re doing, and we get that podium, then I’ll be OK. And it’s exactly what ended up happening today. We had our chance starting from P2. Probably, if you asked many of us yesterday, we didn’t believe the podium was actually achievable with so many fast cars behind. But I think we’ve had good pace this year, we just didn’t have many opportunities to show it. Today we had a very good opportunity to show our very good pace, and we managed to stay on the podium. Only George managed to beat us with very good pace, but it was a very well executed race.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Is that what makes this so special? You said earlier that this tastes sweeter than your first ever podium in Formula 1.</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> Yeah, 100%. This one means even more just because of, obviously, a year ago when I put my bet on Williams, and I said I’m going to this team because I truly believe in this project, and I truly believe that this team is on the rise. I’m very comfortable in this working environment, also very comfortable with everyone around me. And I have actually been pretty fast all year with the car. I think out of everyone that’s changed teams — which is not an easy task nowadays — I’ve been very competitive from the first race, very quick, but I didn’t have results with me. I didn’t have results to prove to myself, the team, and everyone that some good things were about to come. But, in the end, they did. I think life has taught me many times that this sometimes happens — that you have a run of misfortune or bad performances, but then suddenly life gives you back if you keep working hard with something really sweet like this.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Carlos, you’ve got your first podium for Williams before Lewis has got his first podium for Ferrari. Can we get your thoughts on that?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> What everyone else does is not my business, to be honest. What I care about is that the first opportunity that I had to score a podium with Williams, and the first opportunity Williams had to score a podium, we took it, we scored it, and there it is.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Final one from me. What else is possible with this car in 2025?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> Not much more than this, to be honest. I think the podium is — unless something crazy happens — maybe our best chance. Probably Vegas will be our next best track to try and maybe put together a top five or a top six, which is what we sometimes can achieve when everything goes right. Apologies, it’s a tough ask. I’ll fight for it if it comes, like you’ve seen today. But the rest, for example in Qatar, I don’t think we will score points. That’s how much our performance swings. But then we will have the Austins, the Mexicos. We will be a pure midfield car where we can maybe get in the points and keep our championship going. So excited to see what happens in those races.<br /> <br /><strong>QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR</strong><br /> <br /><strong>Q: (Jesus Balseiro – Diario AS) Question to Carlos. Third place is quite nice, but was it ever possible to be second today? Do you think you could have done anything different, obviously on strategy, to keep George behind?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> Yeah. Obviously, I was racing for second the whole race, but I think it was around the first 10 laps of the Hard tyre where I was expecting to be clearly quicker than George on a new Hard versus his old Hard that I said, \"If now I can put my car in front of him before he boxes, we have a chance for P2.\" But then they started telling me his lap times on those used Hards versus my new Hard, and I saw there was no chance. They were just simply too quick for us today. So congrats to him and Merc for that. Kimi was also coming quick behind, and I had to change my focus to getting the P3 rather than fighting for the P2.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Carlos, when you saw Max with the Hard tyre at the start, did you think that was a good opportunity for you?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> No. I thought maybe I could have done the same, if I knew. But I knew we had measured during the whole weekend that the left-hand side of the grid was a lot less grip than the right-hand side. So even if I was on a step softer compound, I knew that even with a good start and the short run to Turn 1, with that left side being very dirty, it was probably not enough to get him at the start. I still got a decent start, but it was not enough to put him under pressure. And I think for the Hard tyres, he must have done a good start.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: (Aynur Mehdiyeva – Racebrief.com) My question is for Carlos. First of all, congratulations with your first podium with the Williams team in Baku. Did you follow some specific strategy during the race?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> No. No. I just knew — I think on long runs on Friday, I saw my lap times and I saw that I’m actually very quick, very competitive. So if it’s not easy to overtake back there, they’re going to struggle to get to me because I’m not slow. That’s why yesterday, I said I was dreaming about the podium, but in reality, I was kind of believing that if we nailed everything, we could actually make it happen because our pace has genuinely been good all year in this kind of tracks. I’ve been quick. The car has been quick. And if we nail everything, I thought a top five was possible. And if we do everything perfect, maybe even the podium.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine Brazil) Question to the three drivers, please. Next Grand Prix will be in Singapore. Is this the most difficult race of the F1 season? And if so, why?</strong><br /><strong>MV:</strong> Depends on a lot of things. If the car is shocking to drive, yes, it’s really hard to keep it in a straight line. But if the car is nice to drive, then it’s more about just the physicality of it. But at the same time, if everything’s going well, then you can relax a bit more, and then naturally it’s less physical as well. So, I don’t know. Let’s wait and see. I mean, it’s for sure always hot and you’re sweating a lot, so you have to prepare for that. But I guess we’ve all done that — heat training and stuff — preparing for these kinds of races. Basically, just getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. I don’t mind it. It’s a cool track. Of course, I’ve never won there, but it’s a cool feeling to drive there, and I hope this year we’ll be a bit more competitive.<br /><strong>GR: </strong>Same.<br /><strong>CS:</strong> Yeah. I think Singapore is very tough physically, but I think driving-wise, the race we just had here in Baku is probably the toughest of the year given the wind, the walls. The speeds that we do here is, for me, tougher as a driver than Singapore. But Singapore is more physically demanding.<br /> <br /> <br /><strong>ENDS</strong></p>  <a href=\"https://www.fia.com/championship/fia-formula-one-world-championship\">FIA Formula One World Championship</a><div class=\"category-icon news\"></div><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/1041\">Formula 1</a><img alt=\"\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/news/main_image/1b833874-6a8f-6054-81a6-d97a126a6449.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/2071\">SEASON 2025</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/12\">Sport</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/family/circuit\">Circuit</a>1SportFIA Formula One World ChampionshipCircuitSEASON 2025Formula 100<span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, September 21, 2025 - 4:37pm</span><span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, September 21, 2025 - 4:37pm</span>",

And, you know, had it been Singapore, as an example, I think I probably would have called it a day on Friday, to be honest, and probably wouldn’t have done the race. So, yeah, sort of fortunate timing. And I haven’t been ill for a couple of years, actually, so it just all sort of hit me at once these days, but I’m on the up now.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Quick word on the Constructors’ Championship, please. Mercedes in P2, four points now ahead of Ferrari. How do you see this one playing out over the remaining seven races? Do you expect it to go to the wire, or do you think one of you will gain an advantage?</strong><br /><strong>GR:</strong> Well, I think right now with the current form, there’s as much chance of Max finishing ahead of us as there is Ferrari, to be honest.<br /><strong>MV:</strong> Red Bull, no?<br /><strong>GR: </strong>Yeah, team Verstappen! But, yeah — sorry, I lost my train of thought there. It just swings so quickly. Ferrari were looking amazingly strong on Friday here, and they’ve always been great here. You know, Charles has been on pole four times here, and they could have easily been one-two on the grid. And with how difficult overtaking is, they probably would have finished one-two as well. But, obviously, they had a bad qualifying, and they came away with single-figure points, and we were the ones coming away with 30 points, so nobody knows.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Very well done. Thank you for that. Carlos, if we could come to you. First podium for Williams — very well done. What was the key to this result, first of all?</strong><br /><strong>Carlos SAINZ:</strong> The key was probably just nailing a perfect weekend from practice, quali, to race. It’s what I’ve been looking for since the beginning of the season — just to nail a perfect weekend. I think we had almost a perfect one in Jeddah when we scored maximum points, but then the rest of the season has been really up and down with a lot more downs than ups. Very unlucky in some cases. Job not well done in others — by me or by other things that were in our control. But I always said to the team from the beginning that whenever a first big opportunity of fighting for a podium comes, as long as we have everything under control and nothing goes wrong and we prove to everyone what we’re doing, and we get that podium, then I’ll be OK. And it’s exactly what ended up happening today. We had our chance starting from P2. Probably, if you asked many of us yesterday, we didn’t believe the podium was actually achievable with so many fast cars behind. But I think we’ve had good pace this year, we just didn’t have many opportunities to show it. Today we had a very good opportunity to show our very good pace, and we managed to stay on the podium. Only George managed to beat us with very good pace, but it was a very well executed race.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Is that what makes this so special? You said earlier that this tastes sweeter than your first ever podium in Formula 1.</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> Yeah, 100%. This one means even more just because of, obviously, a year ago when I put my bet on Williams, and I said I’m going to this team because I truly believe in this project, and I truly believe that this team is on the rise. I’m very comfortable in this working environment, also very comfortable with everyone around me. And I have actually been pretty fast all year with the car. I think out of everyone that’s changed teams — which is not an easy task nowadays — I’ve been very competitive from the first race, very quick, but I didn’t have results with me. I didn’t have results to prove to myself, the team, and everyone that some good things were about to come. But, in the end, they did. I think life has taught me many times that this sometimes happens — that you have a run of misfortune or bad performances, but then suddenly life gives you back if you keep working hard with something really sweet like this.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Carlos, you’ve got your first podium for Williams before Lewis has got his first podium for Ferrari. Can we get your thoughts on that?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> What everyone else does is not my business, to be honest. What I care about is that the first opportunity that I had to score a podium with Williams, and the first opportunity Williams had to score a podium, we took it, we scored it, and there it is.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Final one from me. What else is possible with this car in 2025?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> Not much more than this, to be honest. I think the podium is — unless something crazy happens — maybe our best chance. Probably Vegas will be our next best track to try and maybe put together a top five or a top six, which is what we sometimes can achieve when everything goes right. Apologies, it’s a tough ask. I’ll fight for it if it comes, like you’ve seen today. But the rest, for example in Qatar, I don’t think we will score points. That’s how much our performance swings. But then we will have the Austins, the Mexicos. We will be a pure midfield car where we can maybe get in the points and keep our championship going. So excited to see what happens in those races.<br /> <br /><strong>QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR</strong><br /> <br /><strong>Q: (Jesus Balseiro – Diario AS) Question to Carlos. Third place is quite nice, but was it ever possible to be second today? Do you think you could have done anything different, obviously on strategy, to keep George behind?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> Yeah. Obviously, I was racing for second the whole race, but I think it was around the first 10 laps of the Hard tyre where I was expecting to be clearly quicker than George on a new Hard versus his old Hard that I said, \"If now I can put my car in front of him before he boxes, we have a chance for P2.\" But then they started telling me his lap times on those used Hards versus my new Hard, and I saw there was no chance. They were just simply too quick for us today. So congrats to him and Merc for that. Kimi was also coming quick behind, and I had to change my focus to getting the P3 rather than fighting for the P2.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: Carlos, when you saw Max with the Hard tyre at the start, did you think that was a good opportunity for you?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> No. I thought maybe I could have done the same, if I knew. But I knew we had measured during the whole weekend that the left-hand side of the grid was a lot less grip than the right-hand side. So even if I was on a step softer compound, I knew that even with a good start and the short run to Turn 1, with that left side being very dirty, it was probably not enough to get him at the start. I still got a decent start, but it was not enough to put him under pressure. And I think for the Hard tyres, he must have done a good start.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: (Aynur Mehdiyeva – Racebrief.com) My question is for Carlos. First of all, congratulations with your first podium with the Williams team in Baku. Did you follow some specific strategy during the race?</strong><br /><strong>CS:</strong> No. No. I just knew — I think on long runs on Friday, I saw my lap times and I saw that I’m actually very quick, very competitive. So if it’s not easy to overtake back there, they’re going to struggle to get to me because I’m not slow. That’s why yesterday, I said I was dreaming about the podium, but in reality, I was kind of believing that if we nailed everything, we could actually make it happen because our pace has genuinely been good all year in this kind of tracks. I’ve been quick. The car has been quick. And if we nail everything, I thought a top five was possible. And if we do everything perfect, maybe even the podium.<br /> <br /><strong>Q: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine Brazil) Question to the three drivers, please. Next Grand Prix will be in Singapore. Is this the most difficult race of the F1 season? And if so, why?</strong><br /><strong>MV:</strong> Depends on a lot of things. If the car is shocking to drive, yes, it’s really hard to keep it in a straight line. But if the car is nice to drive, then it’s more about just the physicality of it. But at the same time, if everything’s going well, then you can relax a bit more, and then naturally it’s less physical as well. So, I don’t know. Let’s wait and see. I mean, it’s for sure always hot and you’re sweating a lot, so you have to prepare for that. But I guess we’ve all done that — heat training and stuff — preparing for these kinds of races. Basically, just getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. I don’t mind it. It’s a cool track. Of course, I’ve never won there, but it’s a cool feeling to drive there, and I hope this year we’ll be a bit more competitive.<br /><strong>GR: </strong>Same.<br /><strong>CS:</strong> Yeah. I think Singapore is very tough physically, but I think driving-wise, the race we just had here in Baku is probably the toughest of the year given the wind, the walls. The speeds that we do here is, for me, tougher as a driver than Singapore. But Singapore is more physically demanding.<br /> <br /> <br /><strong>ENDS</strong></p>  <a href=\"https://www.fia.com/championship/fia-formula-one-world-championship\">FIA Formula One World Championship</a><div class=\"category-icon news\"></div><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/1041\">Formula 1</a><img alt=\"\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/news/main_image/1b833874-6a8f-6054-81a6-d97a126a6449.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/2071\">SEASON 2025</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/12\">Sport</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/family/circuit\">Circuit</a>1SportFIA Formula One World ChampionshipCircuitSEASON 2025Formula 100<span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, September 21, 2025 - 4:37pm</span><span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, September 21, 2025 - 4:37pm</span>",

Norway’s Ole Christian Veiby delivered a commanding performance to take his third career World RX victory, while Johan Kristoffersson’s runner-up finish was enough to confirm his record-equalling eighth FIA world title.</strong><br /><br />The result puts Kristoffersson alongside Sébastien Ogier as an eight-time FIA World Champion, just one shy of Sébastien Loeb and Daniel Elena’s all-time record of nine. For KMS, the weekend marked not only their second 1-2 finish of the 2025 season but also the clinching of the Teams’ Championship - further proof of their iron grip on the discipline.<br /><br />Veiby was in sparkling form from the outset. A near-faultless qualifying session saw the Norwegian top all but one of Sunday’s heats, before carrying that momentum into the semi-finals. There, he made short work of his opposition, leading from the front to secure a place in the final alongside 16-year-old wildcard Joni Turpeinen and Germany’s Nils Volland.<br /><br />In the day’s second semi-final, Kristoffersson lined up on pole against a brace of CE Dealer Team challengers - Niclas Grönholm and Klara Andersson - with wildcard entries Mikka Liimatainen, Tamás Kárai and Attila Mózer completing the grid. When the lights went out, it was Liimatainen who shocked the field with a lightning getaway, briefly edging Kristoffersson before contact sent the Finn rolling his PGRX-run Hyundai i20 in dramatic fashion bringing out the red flags. On the restart it was the championship regulars who prevailed, with Kristoffersson, Grönholm and Andersson progressing to the final.<br /><br />With the semi-finals complete, the stage was set for the day’s final. Ole Christian Veiby and Johan Kristoffersson occupied the front row for KMS, with 16-year-old Joni Turpeinen - the youngest World RX driver in history - and Niclas Grönholm just behind. Wildcard entrant Nils Volland lined up alongside CE Dealer Team’s Klara Andersson to round out the six-car grid.<br /><br />When the lights went out, Veiby made no mistakes. Launching his Volkswagen Polo RX1e into the lead at turn one, he immediately settled into a rhythm, soaking up pressure from his more decorated team-mate. Kristoffersson stayed glued to his bumper, ready to strike if opportunity arose, but with the championship secured he resisted his usual late-race heroics, instead playing the consummate team-mate role by shadowing Veiby and covering off Grönholm. That tactical discipline sealed not only the Drivers’ crown but also the Teams’ Championship for KMS.<br /><br />Behind the dominant KMS duo, the drive of the day arguably belonged to wildcard Joni Turpeinen. At just 16 years old, the Finn stunned the field with his composure, holding third place for much of the race despite relentless pressure from Volland and Grönholm. The fairy-tale podium slipped away only on the final lap, when Grönholm muscled his way past, leaving Turpeinen to settle for a hugely impressive fourth place on his World RX debut.<br /><br />Andersson brought her CE Dealer Team car home in fifth after a weekend of battling the tricky, low-grip gravel surface, which blunted her pace throughout. Volland, meanwhile, rounded out the top six. The German’s race unravelled after losing ground to Grönholm in the early laps and dropping further back with a poorly timed joker that left him stranded at the tail of the field.<br /><br /><strong>Ole Christian Veiby, Kristoffersson Motorsport</strong><strong>,</strong> said: “It’s an amazing feeling. Yesterday was tricky, we had a lot of pace but the final didn’t work out. Today the car worked just brilliantly. I got some help from Johan earlier with team tactics, but it feels really good to beat him on pace in the final. I want to say a huge thank you to the team for this year and for all the other years we have been together.”<br /><br /><strong>Johan Kristoffersson, Kristoffersson Motorspor</strong>t, said: “I feel exceptionally proud, not just of myself but of all the guys in the team and all our partners. I tried everything today to try to help Ole Christian catch Niclas in the Drivers’ Championship. I believe he missed out by just one point, so it was a really tight battle. Ole Christian drove very well in the final, and it was really nice to push hard for six laps.”<br /><br /><strong>Niclas Grönholm, CE Dealer Team,</strong> said: “I’m proud of everything we achieved this season, from the win in Portugal and our three podiums, to setting the pace in Finland and finishing second in the championship. Looking back, I feel there is not much else I could have done. The only thing I would have changed was our luck in Hungary and at home, but that is something out of my hands.”<br /><br />Click <a href=\"https://fia.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d2e7b24d2c1e6cecc65ebe300&amp;id=2f42929ae6&amp;e=1d343b7274\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a> for high-resolution imagery.<br /><br />Click <a href=\"https://fia.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d2e7b24d2c1e6cecc65ebe300&amp;id=e57bb36d62&amp;e=1d343b7274\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a> to view the provisional classification from the World RX of Türkiye.<br /><br />Click <a href=\"https://fia.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d2e7b24d2c1e6cecc65ebe300&amp;id=d227a1c4de&amp;e=1d343b7274\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a> to view the provisional championship standings. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>João Ribeiro crowned Euro RX3 Champion as Gurklys takes victory on Turkish soil</strong></h5><h5> </h5></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"media-element file-fia-image-full content-details\" src=\"https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/styles/content_details/public/img_0780.jpg?itok=826f_5Os\" /></p><p><strong>The 2025 FIA European Rallycross RX3 Championship season reached a dramatic conclusion in Istanbul, as Portugal’s João Ribeiro was crowned Euro RX3 champion while Lithuania’s Rytis Gurklys stormed to victory in the final.</strong><br /><br />The 42-year-old Baltar native has been the standout performer of the season, delivering consistent speed and precision across Europe. In Türkiye, Ribeiro once again proved his class, dominating qualifying and the semi-finals to secure enough points to clinch his maiden FIA European Rallycross RX3 title.<br /><br />His run, however, ended in frustration. A brake failure after the semi-finals sidelined him before the all-important final. But by then, the work was already done: Ribeiro’s tally guaranteed his first European crown, capping off a breakthrough campaign for the Portuguese driver.<br /><br />With Ribeiro out of the final, the spotlight shifted to his season-long rival, Rytis Gurklys. The Lithuanian lined up on pole and launched into the lead, fending off Hungarian contender Sámuel Kovács into turn one. From there, Gurklys controlled the race, building a commanding advantage that no one could match.<br /><br />It was a fitting finale for the young star, who pushed Ribeiro hard throughout the season and confirmed his status as one of the brightest prospects in the Euro RX paddock.<br /><br />While Gurklys checked out up front, the battle behind lit up the Istanbul crowd. Antigua’s Nicolas Geleyns delivered one of the performances of the season, showing both speed and flair. After a slow getaway, he set about chasing Kovács for second place.<br /><br />Attempting a bold move around the outside, Geleyns clipped the front of Kovács’ Skoda Fabia and was pitched into a dramatic 360-degree spin. Somehow, the teenager kept his foot in, pulled off a pirouette that echoed Timmy Hansen’s Holjes heroics, and rejoined still ahead of Kovács. The grandstands erupted, and Geleyns pressed on to chase Gurklys, ultimately finishing a superb second in only his rookie campaign.<br /><br />For Kovács, the contact with Geleyns marked the beginning of the end. Pushed off line, he bogged down in the loose gravel and was forced into retirement, his hopes of a podium evaporating.<br /><br />Kovács’ loss was Sousa’s gain, as the Portuguese driver, swept through to claim third place. Sousa had earlier lost time in a first-corner fight with Kovács but capitalised late to secure a spot on the rostrum and end his season on a high.<br /><br />For fellow countryman and family member Rogério Sousa, the luck ran out early. A mechanical issue forced him to pull off just metres after turn two, ending his hopes of a strong finish in heartbreaking fashion.<br /><br />With Ribeiro crowned champion, Gurklys victorious in Türkiye, and emerging stars like Geleyns making their mark, the 2025 Euro RX3 season ends in fine health. The championship continues to prove itself as the proving ground for rallycross talent, and attention now turns to 2026, where rising drivers will look to follow Ribeiro’s path and write their own chapter in European rallycross history.<br /><br /><strong>2025 FIA European RX3 Rallycross Champion, João Ribeiro</strong>, said: “I’m so happy to finally be champion, it really feels amazing. The weekend didn’t finish the way I wanted after the brake problem kept me out of the final, but the work was already done in qualifying and the semi-finals. The important thing was to stay calm, avoid mistakes and make sure I secured the points we needed.<br /><br />Of course, I would have liked to end the season fighting for another win, but the championship is what matters. Now we can celebrate properly - it’s a very special moment.”<br /><br /><strong>Rytis Gurklys, NG Racing Team</strong>, added: “I’m really happy to finish on the top step here in Turkey. The semi-final was tough with a lot of mistakes, but I kept calm and delivered in the final. Of course, P2 in the championship isn’t what I wanted, I wanted P1, but that just makes me more determined for next year. I’ll be back in RX3 in 2026, pushing to finally become champion.”<br /><br /><strong>Nicolas Geleyns, Volland Racing,</strong> commented: I’m so happy with this result. The semi-final was tough, I made mistakes and thought my weekend might be over, but to come back and finish P2 on the podium feels amazing. That 360 moments with Kovács was crazy. For a second I thought I was heading straight into the wall, but I kept it together, stayed on the throttle and somehow saved it. It looked cool, and the fans loved it, so I’m glad it worked out.<br /><br />This year it seems like every podium for me has been P2, but hopefully next year it will be P1. The Turkish fans have been incredible, so passionate and so supportive, it really felt special to race here.”<br /><br /><strong>André Sousa</strong>, said: “I’m really pleased to finish the season on the podium here in Türkiye. It was a tough race, but I stayed focused and managed to bring the car home in third place. It’s a great way to end the year, and I want to thank my team and everyone who has supported me throughout the season.”<br /><br />Click <a href=\"https://mcusercontent.com/d2e7b24d2c1e6cecc65ebe300/files/ac6679a2-cc9a-83d3-ccdc-1ff7ce1e083a/EuroRX3_final_classification_TUR_2025_signed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to view the final classification from the Euro RX3 of Türkiye.<br /><br />Click <a href=\"https://mcusercontent.com/d2e7b24d2c1e6cecc65ebe300/files/39af1c02-6cc3-e20d-9a0b-0c5f9e4d68ac/EuroRX3_ch_point_TUR_2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to view the provisional championship standings. </p><p> </p>  <a href=\"https://www.fia.com/championship/world-rallycross-championship\">World Rallycross Championship</a><div class=\"category-icon news\"></div><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/tags/world-rx\">World RX</a><img alt=\"\" height=\"2937\" src=\"https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/news/main_image/qba_9367.jpg\" width=\"4405\" /><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/2071\">SEASON 2025</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/12\">Sport</a><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/family/road\">Off-Road</a>1SportWorld Rallycross ChampionshipOff-RoadSEASON 2025World RX00<span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, September 21, 2025 - 5:31pm</span><span class=\"date-display-single\">Sunday, September 21, 2025 - 6:31pm</span>",

Norway’s Ole Christian Veiby delivered a commanding performance to take his third career World RX victory, while Johan Kristoffersson’s runner-up finish was enough to confirm his record-equalling eighth FIA world title.</strong><br /><br />The result puts Kristoffersson alongside Sébastien Ogier as an eight-time FIA World Champion, just one shy of Sébastien Loeb and Daniel Elena’s all-time record of nine. For KMS, the weekend marked not only their second 1-2 finish of the 2025 season but also the clinching of the Teams’ Championship - further proof of their iron grip on the discipline.<br /><br />Veiby was in sparkling form from the outset. A near-faultless qualifying session saw the Norwegian top all but one of Sunday’s heats, before carrying that momentum into the semi-finals. There, he made short work of his opposition, leading from the front to secure a place in the final alongside 16-year-old wildcard Joni Turpeinen and Germany’s Nils Volland.<br /><br />In the day’s second semi-final, Kristoffersson lined up on pole against a brace of CE Dealer Team challengers - Niclas Grönholm and Klara Andersson - with wildcard entries Mikka Liimatainen, Tamás Kárai and Attila Mózer completing the grid. When the lights went out, it was Liimatainen who shocked the field with a lightning getaway, briefly edging Kristoffersson before contact sent the Finn rolling his PGRX-run Hyundai i20 in dramatic fashion bringing out the red flags. On the restart it was the championship regulars who prevailed, with Kristoffersson, Grönholm and Andersson progressing to the final.<br /><br />With the semi-finals complete, the stage was set for the day’s final. Ole Christian Veiby and Johan Kristoffersson occupied the front row for KMS, with 16-year-old Joni Turpeinen - the youngest World RX driver in history - and Niclas Grönholm just behind. Wildcard entrant Nils Volland lined up alongside CE Dealer Team’s Klara Andersson to round out the six-car grid.<br /><br />When the lights went out, Veiby made no mistakes. Launching his Volkswagen Polo RX1e into the lead at turn one, he immediately settled into a rhythm, soaking up pressure from his more decorated team-mate. Kristoffersson stayed glued to his bumper, ready to strike if opportunity arose, but with the championship secured he resisted his usual late-race heroics, instead playing the consummate team-mate role by shadowing Veiby and covering off Grönholm. That tactical discipline sealed not only the Drivers’ crown but also the Teams’ Championship for KMS.<br /><br />Behind the dominant KMS duo, the drive of the day arguably belonged to wildcard Joni Turpeinen. At just 16 years old, the Finn stunned the field with his composure, holding third place for much of the race despite relentless pressure from Volland and Grönholm. The fairy-tale podium slipped away only on the final lap, when Grönholm muscled his way past, leaving Turpeinen to settle for a hugely impressive fourth place on his World RX debut.<br /><br />Andersson brought her CE Dealer Team car home in fifth after a weekend of battling the tricky, low-grip gravel surface, which blunted her pace throughout. Volland, meanwhile, rounded out the top six. The German’s race unravelled after losing ground to Grönholm in the early laps and dropping further back with a poorly timed joker that left him stranded at the tail of the field.<br /><br /><strong>Ole Christian Veiby, Kristoffersson Motorsport</strong><strong>,</strong> said: “It’s an amazing feeling. Yesterday was tricky, we had a lot of pace but the final didn’t work out. Today the car worked just brilliantly. I got some help from Johan earlier with team tactics, but it feels really good to beat him on pace in the final. I want to say a huge thank you to the team for this year and for all the other years we have been together.”<br /><br /><strong>Johan Kristoffersson, Kristoffersson Motorspor</strong>t, said: “I feel exceptionally proud, not just of myself but of all the guys in the team and all our partners. I tried everything today to try to help Ole Christian catch Niclas in the Drivers’ Championship. I believe he missed out by just one point, so it was a really tight battle. Ole Christian drove very well in the final, and it was really nice to push hard for six laps.”<br /><br /><strong>Niclas Grönholm, CE Dealer Team,</strong> said: “I’m proud of everything we achieved this season, from the win in Portugal and our three podiums, to setting the pace in Finland and finishing second in the championship. Looking back, I feel there is not much else I could have done.

    "summary": "Sport news<p>The 2025 FIA European Historic Rally Championship returns to asphalt this week, as Rallye Elba Storico brings the continent’s finest historic crews to the twisting mountain and coastal roads of the Tuscan Island. With the championship fight finely poised and rain in the forecast, the Mediterranean stages promise to test precision, patience and bravery in equal measure.</p><p>For all its postcard beauty – from Porto Azzurro’s pastel harbour to the sheer cliffs above the Formiche della Zanca – Elba is anything but a holiday drive. The rally has a reputation for punishing, narrow sections that leave no margin for error, where the wrong tyre call or the slightest lapse in concentration can end a campaign in a stone wall or vineyard.</p><p>Leading the home charge are Italians Angelo Lombardo and Consiglio Roberto, whose Porsche 911 RS is as much a fixture of the EHRC as their attacking style. After claiming victory on the Italian Island last year and banking 28 points on the asphalt of Antibes earlier this year, they will be desperate to repeat the feat on home soil and take top honours in FIA Category 2.</p><p>Standing in their way is championship leader Maciej Lubiak, whose black-and-white Porsche 911 RS has been relentlessly consistent – three podiums from as many outings, have put the Pole in command of the standings. Elba, though, is no place to play it safe, and with only a slender cushion to protect the Pentacar driver, Lubiak will have to balance experience with aggression to claim victory on the Italian Island.</p><p>Just ten points behind lurk Flexifly Rally Team’s Will and Karen Graham. Their BMW M3 E30, an icon of late-’80s rallying, will need every ounce of Bavarian horsepower to muscle ahead of the Porsches. For the Grahams, a strong run on Italian asphalt could tilt the championship fight in their favour with only three rounds left in play.</p><p>Italian pride doesn’t stop with Lombardo. Enrico Brazzoli and Martina Musiari, flying the flag for Pentacar Racing Team, arrive fresh from impressive runs in Vltava and Weiz. Fifth in the overall table, their experience on tarmac and home-field advantage make them a dark horse for outright victory.</p><p>Category 1 promises an all-Italian showdown, as local hero Carlo Fiorito lines up his BMW 2002 TI against Antonio Parisi’s Porsche 911 S. With both drivers boasting proven pedigree in the FIA European Historic Championship, sparks are sure to fly for top honours.</p><p>In Category 2B Flexifly boss Ernie Graham returns in his beloved Ford Escort RS1800 alongside Karen Graham, the pair carrying momentum from a strong gravel campaign. They face a direct duel with French pairing Bertrand Metivier and Fabrice Garin, with both crews equal on points heading into Elba a strong performance could tilt the championship in their favour.</p><p>The P2 class offers a slice of ’90s nostalgia, with Matteo Ricaldone and Alessandro Floris back in their Peugeot 306 Maxi – a fan favourite from the asphalt-specialist era.

    "content": "Sport news<p>The 2025 FIA European Historic Rally Championship returns to asphalt this week, as Rallye Elba Storico brings the continent’s finest historic crews to the twisting mountain and coastal roads of the Tuscan Island. With the championship fight finely poised and rain in the forecast, the Mediterranean stages promise to test precision, patience and bravery in equal measure.</p><p>For all its postcard beauty – from Porto Azzurro’s pastel harbour to the sheer cliffs above the Formiche della Zanca – Elba is anything but a holiday drive. The rally has a reputation for punishing, narrow sections that leave no margin for error, where the wrong tyre call or the slightest lapse in concentration can end a campaign in a stone wall or vineyard.</p><p>Leading the home charge are Italians Angelo Lombardo and Consiglio Roberto, whose Porsche 911 RS is as much a fixture of the EHRC as their attacking style. After claiming victory on the Italian Island last year and banking 28 points on the asphalt of Antibes earlier this year, they will be desperate to repeat the feat on home soil and take top honours in FIA Category 2.</p><p>Standing in their way is championship leader Maciej Lubiak, whose black-and-white Porsche 911 RS has been relentlessly consistent – three podiums from as many outings, have put the Pole in command of the standings. Elba, though, is no place to play it safe, and with only a slender cushion to protect the Pentacar driver, Lubiak will have to balance experience with aggression to claim victory on the Italian Island.</p><p>Just ten points behind lurk Flexifly Rally Team’s Will and Karen Graham. Their BMW M3 E30, an icon of late-’80s rallying, will need every ounce of Bavarian horsepower to muscle ahead of the Porsches. For the Grahams, a strong run on Italian asphalt could tilt the championship fight in their favour with only three rounds left in play.</p><p>Italian pride doesn’t stop with Lombardo. Enrico Brazzoli and Martina Musiari, flying the flag for Pentacar Racing Team, arrive fresh from impressive runs in Vltava and Weiz. Fifth in the overall table, their experience on tarmac and home-field advantage make them a dark horse for outright victory.</p><p>Category 1 promises an all-Italian showdown, as local hero Carlo Fiorito lines up his BMW 2002 TI against Antonio Parisi’s Porsche 911 S. With both drivers boasting proven pedigree in the FIA European Historic Championship, sparks are sure to fly for top honours.</p><p>In Category 2B Flexifly boss Ernie Graham returns in his beloved Ford Escort RS1800 alongside Karen Graham, the pair carrying momentum from a strong gravel campaign. They face a direct duel with French pairing Bertrand Metivier and Fabrice Garin, with both crews equal on points heading into Elba a strong performance could tilt the championship in their favour.</p><p>The P2 class offers a slice of ’90s nostalgia, with Matteo Ricaldone and Alessandro Floris back in their Peugeot 306 Maxi – a fan favourite from the asphalt-specialist era. While France’s Richard Genesca will look to spoil the party, keeping the battle for P2 honours very much alive.</p><p>Rallye Elba Storico will also welcome a pair of eye-catching wildcard entries. Belgian duo Glenn and Conrad Janssens bring the rare Ferrari 208 Michelotto – the marque’s only rally car to have competed in the legendary Group B era, and the first Ferrari to feature in this year’s EHRC.

Our participation in Clean Up the World is a reflection of our belief that environmental stewardship must go hand-in-hand with sporting excellence.”</p><p>Through initiatives like this, SKA continues to set a strong example for small island nations and emerging motor sport communities, showing that environmental action and motorsport development can progress together.</p><div class=\"category-icon news\"></div><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/tags/members\">Members</a><img alt=\"Seychelles Karting Association Leads by Example with ‘Clean Up the World’ Campaign\" height=\"3000\" src=\"https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/news/main_image/1000065710.jpg\" title=\"Seychelles Karting Association Leads by Example with ‘Clean Up the World’ Campaign\" width=\"4000\" /><a href=\"https://www.fia.com/taxonomy/term/822\">Members</a>1MembersMembers00<span class=\"date-display-single\">Monday, September 22, 2025 - 11:28am</span><span class=\"date-display-single\">Monday, September 22, 2025 - 11:28am</span>",
